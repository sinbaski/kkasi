\section{Regular Variation}
The concept of regular variation is defined by the following scaling
property: If a function $f(\cdot)$ satisfies
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} {f(c x) \over f(x)} = c^\alpha
\]
then we say $f(x)$ is regularly varying with index $\alpha$.
Distribution functions, say $F(\cdot)$, whose survival function
$\bar F(x) = 1 - F(x)$ satisfies the above scaling property, are
observed in a variety of phenomena, for example, phase transition of
matter, black body radiation, neuronal avalanches and stock returns.
When expanded to multiple dimensions, the scaling property is better
described in terms of weak convergence to a spectral measure: If a
random vector $V$ satisfies
\[
\lim_{x \to \infty}
{
  \P(V/|V| \in \cdot, |V| > c x)
  \over
  \P(|V| > x)
}
\overset{w}{\to} c^{-\alpha} \mu_\alpha(\cdot)
\]
then we say the components of $V$ is jointly regularly varying with
index $\alpha$. Here $\mu_\alpha(\cdot)$ is a probability measure on
the unit sphere \cite{buraczewski:damek:mikosch:2016}. Clearly, if $V$
is jointly regularly varying with index $\alpha$, then each component
of it and each linear combination of its components are regularly
varying with the same index $\alpha$. This follows from Feller
\cite{feller}, p. 278. Cf. also Jessen and Mikosch
\cite{JessenMikosch2006}, lemma 3.1, and Embrechts et al
\cite{embrechts:klueppelberg:mikosch:1997}, lemma 1.3.1.

Thus estimating the tail index $\alpha$ is particularly important for
understanding the behaviour of a heavy-tailed series. The earliest
method proposed for this purpose is due to Hill \cite{hill1975simple}:
\[
\hat \alpha_H = \left[
  {1 \over k} \sum_{i=1}^k \log \left(
  X_{(i)} \over X_{(k+1)}
  \right)
  \right]^{-1}
\]
where $X_1, X_2, \dots$ is the series whose tail index is the subject
of estimation, and $X_{(i)}$ is the $i$-th upper order statistics of
this series. Several authors have contributed to showing the
weak consistency of the estimator $\hat \alpha_H$,
i.e. if $k \to \infty, k/n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, then
$\hat \alpha_H \overset{P}{\to} \alpha$.

Mason \cite{mason:1982} first proved that the estimator
was consistent when $X_1, X_2, \dots$ were iid; later Rootz\'en,
Leadbetter and de Haan \cite{rootzen:leadbetter:dehaan1992} and Hsing
\cite{hsing:1991} proved its consistency when $X_1, X_2, \dots$ were
weakly dependent; and Resnick and St{\u a}ric{\u a}
\cite{resnick:starica:1995, resnick:starica:1997} proved its
consistency when $X_t$ was a linear process.





 
\section{Contribution of this thesis}\label{sec:contr}

In this section we summarize our results from the research papers.

\subsection{Tail parameters of equity return series}
We have established that, in the case of an equity return series with
two-sided, functionally independent Pareto tails, investor
preference functionals are monotone increasing/decreasing with the
tail index/scale parameters. Thus in a market dominated by such
equities, the investors would pursue the largest tail index in the
market, leading to a shared common tail index for all equities.

The empirical results presented in section \ref{sec:1} suggest this
may well be the case for the ``Consumer Staples'' sector of S\&P 500,
given the Hill estimates of tail indices shown in figure \ref{fig:1}
and the largely positive results of tests for equal tail indices shown
in figure \ref{fig:PairTest}.

On the other hand, we have also seen that, when the left and the right
tails have the same indices, investor preference over the equity has
more sophisticated variations in the parameters' space including the
tail parameters of the equity, the interest rate, the investor's risk
apetite as captured by his utility function, and his threshold of
disappointment.

We also acknowledge that our model of the market and the investor is a
simple one, not accoounting for the dependence between equities, nor
the categorization of investors and their interactions. These are
potential topics of future work.
