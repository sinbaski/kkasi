Dear Ms. Levin,

I learned from KU's job portal that you were looking for a part-time
assistant analyst to work in your research team. I find this position
really interesting and it matches my background well, so I would like
to ask you for your consideration.

I obtained my master's degree in econophysics from Lund University and
continued last October as a Ph.D of insurance and economics
Mathematics at KU on the basis of self-financing. The Ph.D program is
scheduled to be completed in 3 years.

Given my background, I am confident in my mathematical knowledge and
skills and would very much like to use and improve them in practice. I
first learned about credit risk modeling from a course at KU, and know
about the rationales and calculations of such models as Merton, KMV,
and CreditRisk+. I have also studied the methods of saddlepoint
approximation and importance sampling, and implemented importance
sampling algorithms in Matlab.

As a teamplayer, I enjoying sharing ideas with teammates and learning
from others. Nevertheless, I also hope to advance my career by
specializing and becoming an expert. If you find me the right person
for this job, I would also hope to continue working with you after my
Ph.D studies.

Please find my CV attached. I look forward to hearing from you and
further discussing the opportunity with you.

Best Regards,
Xie Xiaolei
