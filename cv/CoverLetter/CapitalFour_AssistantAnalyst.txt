Dear Ms. Levin,

I learned from KU's job portal that you were looking for a part-time
assistant analyst to work in your research team. I find this position
really interesting and hence would like to ask you for your
consideration.

I obtained my master's degree in econophysics from Lund University and
continued last October as a Ph.D of insurance and economics
Mathematics at KU on the basis of self-financing. The Ph.D program is
scheduled to be completed in 3 years.

Given my background, I am confident in my mathematical knowledge and
skills and would very much like to use and improve them in
practice. In addition, as you pointed out in the job description,
gathering and analyzing information from research documents is an
important part of the role, and I have been doing this routinely as a
Ph.D student.

I first learned about credit risk modeling from a course at KU, and
know about the rationales and calculations of such models as Merton,
KMV, and CreditRisk+. I have also studied the methods of saddlepoint
approximation and importance sampling.

As a person, I am a good team player. I enjoying sharing ideas with
teammates and learning from them. Nevertheless, I also hope to advance
my career by specializing and becoming an expert.

Please find my CV attached. I look forward to hearing from you and
further discussing the opportunity with you.

Best Regards,
Xie Xiaolei
