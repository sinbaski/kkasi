I see on Citi's website that you are recruiting a quantitative
analyst to join your cross asset quantitative analysis team. In the
description of the job, you emphasized knowledge and skills in time
series analysis, C++ programming and understanding of the financial
market. These are indeed areas in which I find confidence. So I would
like to ask you for your consideration.

I am currently a Ph.D student at Copenhagen University, researching in
Mathematical statistics and particularly in time series analysis. I
have co-authored and published two papers on eigen systems of sample
covariance matrices with a focus on heavy-tailed time series. These
results can be helpful in principle component analysis.

I am also finalizing two other papers. One of them is about how an
investor's preference (as characterized by {\em Generalized
  Disappointment Aversion}) of an equity varies with the tail
parameters of the stationary distribution of the equity. I think this
result can be applied to problems of portfolio construction as well as
assessment of the overall market risk. As part of the paper, I also did
statistical analysis on the tail parameters of equities in the S\&P
500 index, specifically, the ``Energy'', ``Consumer Staples'' and
``Information Technology'' sectors. R and C++ programming are
indispensible part of the work.

The other paper of mine is about estimation of the probability of very
large losses posed by portfolios whose volatility dynamics are
described by multivariate GARCH or GARCH(p,q) processes.
