%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% To the Industry %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I understand from ``Monster'' that you are recruiting a quant
developer to join your team. After reading your description 
about the job, I find a very good match between my background and the
qualifications you want for that role, so I would like to ask you for
your consideration.

% % You pointed out at the very beginning of the announcement that your
% % company applied mathematical techniques and wrote software to develop
% % statistical models for computerized trading.  These knowledge and
% % skills –- maths,  statistics, and trading software describe precisely
% % my qualifications.

I am graduating in June, 2014, as a master of econophysics
from Lund University. In my master's thesis, I compared the forecast
performance of GARCH and stochastic volatility (SV) models, and
studied the covariance matrix of GARCH(1,1) returns, with a focus on
eigenvalues' distribution and eigenvectors' composition when the
returns are auto-correlated.

% both analytic and numerical studies of such Swedish stocks as Nordea
% Bank, Volvo B and Ericsson B. Applied probability theory, statistical
% analysis and numerical simulation are the main research methods.
% I have attached a copy of the thesis with this application in case you
% would like to know more.

Besides my education in mathematical physics, I am also a software
professional with 7 years experience in the IT industry. I am very
familiar with C/C++, Matlab and Python programming, and I am
experienced in Java and Databases too.

This combination of solid mathematical knowledge and skills with
years of experience in software and programming is what makes me
confident to be a good and valued member in your team. 
% I long to apply advanced mathematics in a business context and thereby
% add to the success of the team. This gives me a fantastic sense of
% accomplishment and achieved potential.

%In fact I developed a program as
% a hobby project that now functions as a platform for testing trading
% ideas. It collects real-time transaction records on the Stockholm
% stock exchange and analyzes them with Matlab scripts that implement
% returns models of selected stocks, and regularly update the models
% according to new data. These tasks, as I understand from your
% description of the job, are daily routines of that role, so I think I
% will be a good player in your team and really add to its success.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Ph.D of Uppsala %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% I learned from Uppsala University’s website that you were offering two
% Ph.D positions in statistics. I am graduating in June, 2014 as master 
% of physics from Lund University and I am finalizing my thesis at
% present. The positions you offer present a great opportunity for me
% continue my master’s studies, so I am applying.

% I am specialized in econophysics and my thesis is about discrete-time
% volatility models and return series’ cross-correlation matrix.
% Specifically I studied ARIMA log-volatility models in detail, and
% using these modelsdid case studies on Nordea Bank and Volvo B intraday
% returns. I derived the stationary distribution functions of such
% models and estimated the model parameters corresponding to the
% aforementioned return series. I also did volatility forecast using the
% calibrated models and compared the result with the ``realized
% volatilities'' computed from data. The same calibration, forecast and
% comparison were also done using GARCH models, and this allowed me to
% compare and conclude that ARIMA log-volatility models provide more
% accurate forecast than GARCH in most cases.

% I also did some numerical studies on the cross-correlation matrix of
% Gaussian and GARCH(1,1) returns. The aim was to find out how
% auto-correlation in the returns changes the distribution of the matrix
% elements and of the eigenvalues. I showed quantitatively that the
% asymptotic Gaussian distribution of the matrix elements has increased
% mean and variance if the returns are auto-correlated; Furthermore, by
% simulation, I found the largest eigenvalue distribution of the
% cross-correlation matrix of auto-correlated Gaussian returns is
% approximately gamma, as is the largest eigenvalue distribution of a
% real wishart matrix built from un-correlated returns. Nevertheless,
% the parameters of the gamma distribution depend on auto-correlation.

% For GARCH(1,1) returns, I showed analytically that the elements of the
% cross-correlation matrix have asymptotically $\alpha$-stable
% distribution. By simulation, I showed the largest eigenvalues of the
% matrix correspond to a group of localized eigenvectors each of which
% is dominated its largest component in terms of participation
% ratio. The longer the return series, the more localized are such
% eigenvectors. Auto-correlation in the returns, on the other hand,
% decreases the extent of localization.

% As you see, my thesis is very closely related to applied probability
% theory and statistics, and I wish to continue in the same area, namely
% statistical models of finance. I have found the continuous-time price
% models very interesting and taught myself some knowledge of stochastic
% differential equations. I understand that calibrating these models to
% data is very challenging, and their implications on derivative
% pricing are complicated. I would very much like to do research in
% these areas.

I look forward to an interview with you. If you would like to know more
about me, you are most welcome to call me at +46 70 489 0472 or find
me on LinkedIn as ``Xie Xiaolei''. If you want to contact my thesis
supervisor, Prof. Sven \AA berg, he is reachable via telephone +46 46 222
96 33 or mobile +46 70 557 35 69.
