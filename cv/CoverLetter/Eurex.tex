I see on {\em Monster} that you are recruiting a quantitative risk
analyst to join your team of {\em Risk methodology and New products}.
From your description of the responsibilities and requirements, I
understand you are looking for someone who is strong both in
statistical analysis and in software development using Matlab, C++ and
SQL.

As is detailed in my CV, I am anticipating to get my PhD in {\em
  Mathematical Statistics} from Copenhagen University this September
and have co-authored 2 papers on the eigen systems of sample
covariance matrices of heavy tailed time series. At the time of
writing, I am also finalizing two other papers, one about tail
parameters of equity returns and the other about estimation of
the probabilities of large losses by importance sampling.
These results are applicable to principle component analysis,
portfolio optimization as well as risk management; and indeed, I am
keen to apply them and see them making a real impact on business.

Speaking about the application of mathematical models, I think my past
experience as a software developer is worth mentioning. As is detailed
in my CV, I worked as a software developer for 6.5 years in several
companies and accumulated abundant experience in C, C++, R, Matlab
programming as well as in data analysis and algorithm implementation.
Thus I am confident to take on the challenges of a quantitative risk
analyst at {\em Eurex}.

I look forward to discussing the job with you in more
details. You can always call me at +46 76 060 6638 or email me at
xie.xiaolei@gmail.com. It would be my pleasure to hear from you.
