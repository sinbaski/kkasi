\begin{itemize}
\item Davis, R.A., Heiny, J., Mikosch, T. and {\bf Xie, X.},
  2016. {\it Extreme value analysis for the sample autocovariance
    matrices of heavy-tailed multivariate time series}.
  \underline{Extremes}, 19(3), pp.517-547.
  
  {\small
  We provide, among others, a limit theory for the largest eigenvalues
  of a sample covariance matrix of heavy-tailed, possibly linearly
  dependent data with infinite dimensions. We prove weak convergence of
  the point process of the largest eigenvalues to Poisson or cluster
  Poisson processes and, based on this convergence result, derive limit
  laws of functions of the ordered eigenvalues.}

\item Jan\ss en, A., Mikosch, T., Rezapour, M., {\bf Xie, X},
  2016. {\it The eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of a
    multivariate heavy-tailed stochastic volatility model}.
  To appear in the \underline{Bernoulli Journal}.
  
  {\small
  We derive multivariate $\alpha$-stable limit distributions of the
  sample covariance matrix when the sample size was large. We
  consider two possibilities of heavy-tails: 1. the innovation
  sequence is heavy tailed; and 2. the volatility sequence is
  heavy-tailed. While the eigen system of the first case is shown to
  resemble that of i.i.d data, the eigen system in the second case is
  found to allow dependencies in their limiting distributions, which
  are determined by the structure of the volatility sequence.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Papers in Finalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mikosch, T., de Vries, C., {\bf Xie, X.}, 2017,
  {\it Generalized Disappointment Aversion and heavy-tail property of
    equity return distributions}

  {\small
    We study the heavy tail properties of real-world equity return
    distributions and, based on the framework of Generalized
    Disappointment Aversion, derive how an investor's preference varies
    with the tail distribution characteristics, namely the tail index and
    the scale parameter. We find, when the equity return is t-distributed,
    the GDA preference actually decreases with the degree of freedom of
    the distribution, i.e. the tail index; we interprete this as a
    consequence of the symmetry of the distribution. When the equity
    return is assumed to have a shifted Pareto distribution with
    independent parameters of the left and the right tails, we find the
    GDA preference increasing with both the lower tail index and the scale
    parameter. We attribute this to the risk avert nature of rational
    investors. By numerical methods, optimal asset allocation is also
    solved in both cases.

\section{Other information}

\subsection{Review}

Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a
strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She
has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian
virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement,
particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a
``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her
limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes
increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals
with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior
attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she
believes are less privileged.
