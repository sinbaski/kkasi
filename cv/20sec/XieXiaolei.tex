\section{Publications}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Xie, X.}, Davis, R.A., Heiny, J. and Mikosch, T.
  2016. {\it Extreme value analysis for the sample autocovariance
    matrices of heavy-tailed multivariate time series}.
  \underline{Extremes}, 19(3), pp.517-547.
  
  {\small
  We provide, among others, a limit theory for the largest eigenvalues
  of a sample covariance matrix of heavy-tailed, possibly linearly
  dependent data with infinite dimensions. We prove weak convergence of
  the point process of the largest eigenvalues to Poisson or cluster
  Poisson processes and, based on this convergence result, derive limit
  laws of functions of the ordered eigenvalues.}

\item {\bf Xie, X}, Jan\ss en, A., Mikosch, T. and Rezapour, M.
  2016. {\it The eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of a
    multivariate heavy-tailed stochastic volatility model}.
  To appear in the \underline{Bernoulli Journal}.
  
  {\small
  We derive multivariate $\alpha$-stable limit distributions of the
  sample covariance matrix when the sample size was large. We
  consider two possibilities of heavy-tails: 1. the innovation
  sequence is heavy tailed; and 2. the volatility sequence is
  heavy-tailed. While the eigen system of the first case is shown to
  resemble that of i.i.d data, the eigen system in the second case is
  found to allow dependencies in their limiting distributions, which
  are determined by the structure of the volatility sequence.}

\section{Papers in Finalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Xie, X.}, Mikosch, T. and de Vries, C., 2017,
  {\it Tail-indices and scale parameters of returns series}

  {\small
    It is a stylized fact that equity return distributions are
    heavy-tailed. We discuss how an investor's preference of an equity
    varies with the parameters of the tail distribution of the return on
    equity. These parameters can be seen as characteristics of the
    market and provide a quantitative description of the status of the
    market.
    In addition, we also find optimal asset allocation schemes
    corresponding to different investor preferences as captured by the
    investors' utility functions. These results can be useful when
    considering a problem of asset allocation. Real-world stock return
    series, which have motivated our work, are analyzed and presented.

\section{Papers in Finalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Xie, X.} Collamore, J, 2017
  {\it An efficient estimator of the probability of very large losses posed by
    GARCH(p,q) processes}

  {\small
    We propose an efficient importance sampling estimator of the
    probability of excursion over high thresholds (causing large
    losses) by Multivariate Markov chains e.g. a GARCH(p,q) process or
    a multivariate GARCH process.
    Although stationary distributions of these processes are known
    to have power-law tails, precise evaluation of the tail
    probabilities is difficult because the exact distribution is
    unknown. Moreover, naive simulation methods lead to erractic
    estimates. Our importance sampling estimator presents a solution.

    Engineer, Sep 2008 - Jan 2011}

  My responsibilities included developing audio low-level software,
  typically device drivers, in the Linux OS. This involved designing and
  implementing data structures and procedures so that the hardware
  devices were used in the optimal way, in terms of parallelism,
  power consumption, robustness, and ease of maintenance.

  {\it C, C++, Java, Linux}
\item {\it \href{http://www.hiit.fi}{\tt Helsinki
      Institute of Information Technology, Helsinki}, Oct 2007 - May 2008}

  Funded by HIIT, I wrote my thesis ``A Mutual authentication and Key
  Agreement Protocol for the UMTS Network''. The algorithm of my
  protocol proposal was based on the Diffie-Hellman Exchange, but had
  significant modifications and extensions so that the mutual
  authentication between the mobile user and the network was delegated
  to the serving instead of the home network. The protocol design
  incorporated puzzle schemes that demanded unbalanced computing
  resources on the two sides to mitigate Denial-of-Service attacks.
  
  {\it C, C++, Linux}
\item {\it
    \href{http://www.goodmillsystems.com}{\tt Goodmillsystems,
      Helsinki}, Software Designer, May 2007 - Sep 2007}

  I developed a daemon program that ran on the company's smart router
  product to collect statistical data about the router's network
  traffic. The emphasis of the program was high performance in the
  context of competing read and write accesses.

  {\it C, C++, Linux}
\item {\it \href{http://www.cardinal.fi/}{\tt
      Cardinal Information Systems, Helsinki}, Software
    Developer, Sep 2006 - April 2007}

  I implemented the FLUTE protocol for the company's DVB-H
  mobile-end middleware. The implementation was multi-threaded and was
  built on the {\it pthread} library. Good performance and robustness
  were crucial requirements on the implementation.

  {\it C, C++, Linux}
\item {\it
    \href{http://www.digitalchocolate.com/}{\tt Digital Chocolate,

  phone games for various handsets.

  {\it Java, J2ME, Bash}
\item {\it {\tt Beijing Holystone Ltd, Beijing}, Software
    Engineer, April 2004 - June 2005}

  I developed JSP pages and database routines for
  the company's information system.
